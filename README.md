## 🔒 Tips for Safer Use

1. **Use Alt Accounts** - Never run the **roblox fish it script** on your main account; create disposable alternatives for testing
2. **Start with Conservative Settings** - Begin with slower auto-fish speeds (3-5 second delays) before increasing automation
3. **Monitor AFK Sessions** - Check automated sessions every 30-60 minutes to ensure no detection flags
4. **Avoid Peak Hours** - Run intensive automation during off-peak times when fewer players and moderators are active
5. **Rotate Fishing Zones** - Don't stay in one location for hours; use teleport to vary your fishing patterns
6. **Disable Before Updates** - Stop using the script 24 hours before scheduled Fish It! updates to avoid detection
7. **Moderate Earnings** - Avoid earning unrealistic amounts (500K+ coins/hour) that trigger anti-cheat reviews
8. **Use VPN (Optional)** - Additional network protection layer, though not required for script operation
9. **Community Reporting** - If players mention reporting suspicious activity, immediately disable all features
10. **Regular Script Updates** - Always **download fish it script** from official sources for latest security patches
11. **Hub Safety** - Premium hubs like **limithub fish it script** and **blackhub fish it script** provide extra detection protection
12. **Mobile Precautions** - **Fish it script android** users should close background apps to prevent performance issues
